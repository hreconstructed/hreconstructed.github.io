                <h3>What is the Heritage Reconstructed project?</h3>
                        
                <p>The use of Virtual Reality (VR) for purposes other than gaming have been discovered and expanded upon. Within the world of archaeology, the ability to combine game mechanics and alternate realities with archaeological data has allowed for individuals to experience cultures that are no longer around today. </p>
                
                <p>Heritage Reconstructed is an open database collection of archaeological sites that have been digitally reconstructed and have either been lost, or are in danger of being lost due to factors such as warfare, political unrest or environmental events.</p>

                <p>Heritage Reconstructed will not only be for academic or scholar use, but to be used in pedagogy and for those who may have an interest in these topics whom, either do not know where to start, or do not have access to the information outside of academia.</p>

                <h3>Who created Heritage Reconstructed?</h3>

                <p>Heritage Reconstructed has been researched and put together by a group of Graduate students from The Graduate Center, CUNY. To find out more about who they are, please visit the <a href="about">About Us</a> page.</p>

                <h3>Why was this project created?</h3>

                <p>At the moment, there are digital reconstructions being created at various institutions, but there is no centralized place to go to find these reconstructions. Heritage Reconstructed intends to contain a database of these digital reconstructions for Archeologists, Digital Humanists, Art Historians, Researchers, and anyone else interested in these projects. The reconstructions will be searchable within the database and contain information about the project and site. If allowed, the digital reconstructions themselves will be hosted within the database.</p>

                <h3>Why is digitizing these sites important?</h3>

                <p>Once a historically significant location is destroyed, it is difficult to then piece together the site in a meaningful manner. Digital reconstructions help to, not only recreate, but make meaning from something that no longer exists, for further generations to see and visualize.</p>
